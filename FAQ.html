        <!-- FAQ Q 1  -->
        <div class="FAQ-question">
            What is a class action?
        </div>

        <div class="FAQ-response">
            A class action is a representative lawsuit which allows an individual or entity to initiate a lawsuit on behalf of other individuals or entities who are in the same or similar circumstances with respect to a given defendant. A class action is appropriate when many people have been affected by a company's course of conduct in a similar fashion.

        <!-- FAQ Q 2 -->
        <div class="FAQ-question">
            What is a class period?
        </div>

        <div class="FAQ-response">
            A class period is a range of dates within which a company is alleged to have been engaged in improper conduct. The attorneys investigating and prosecuting a case will review the facts of the case, and along with the court-appointed Lead Plaintiff, determine the appropriate beginning and end of a class period. Sometimes, after an initial complaint is filed, a class period will be lengthened or shortened as an investigation continues. If you purchased the securities of a company during a class period, you are automatically a class member, regardless of whether you specifically retain a law firm to prosecute claims on your behalf. This "class membership" concept is also true with respect to consumer fraud class actions and antitrust class actions. For example, if you purchased goods from a company that was accused of improper marketing practices during the relevant period of time (the class period), you would be a member of the class for a consumer fraud class action, even if you did not personally retain an attorney.

        <!-- FAQ Q 3 -->
        <div class="FAQ-question">
            What is a lead plaintiff?
        </div>

        <div class="FAQ-response">
            A lead plaintiff in a class action brought pursuant to the federal securities laws, sometimes referred to as a named plaintiff or representative party, is typically appointed by the court within 90 days of the publication of a notice of the pendency of the class action. In these types of actions, the court selects the class member or members most capable of representing the interests of the "absent" class members. There is a statutory presumption that the class period investor or investors with the largest financial losses, who are otherwise typical of the "absent" class members and are adequate to represent those class members, are considered the "most adequate" plaintiff. Courts have appointed individuals, groups of individuals, institutional investors, groups of institutions, or even combinations of both as lead plaintiff as the circumstances of each case may dictate. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class, and these attorneys if approved by the court are lead counsel or class counsel.

        <div class="FAQ-question">
            How long does it take to prosecute a class action?
        </div>

        <div class="FAQ-response">
            The time to prosecute each class action varies based on the facts, parties, and jurisdiction of a particular case. It is not unusual for a class action to take up to 3 years to complete.

        <!-- FAQ Q 5 -->
        <div class="FAQ-question">
            What is contingency fee litigation?
        </div>

        <div class="FAQ-response">
            Contingency fee litigation refers to situations where attorneys only get paid if they win the case at trial or if the action settles. Attorneys who practice on a contingent fee arrangement typically do not receive any form of monetary payment from a client at the outset of litigation. Rather, the attorneys' fees are paid only once there is a successful resolution from any settlement or judgment that is achieved. There are no out-of-pocket expenses for the plaintiffs as Pennsylvania law allows Kessler Topaz to advance all such costs on behalf of its clients. Kessler Topaz handles virtually all of its cases on a contingency fee basis.
